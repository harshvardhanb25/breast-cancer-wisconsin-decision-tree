# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set Decision Tree

The file `breast-cancer-wisconsin-decision-tree.ipynb` contains a simple decision tree classifier for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. The data was obtained from kaggle.com and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). The data set contains 569 instances with 30 numeric features. The target variable is binary and indicates whether the instance is malignant or benign. The data set is split into a training set and a test set.
The decision tree was implemented within the file along with functions that allowed hyperparameter tuning. The implemented tree supports splitting based on entropy, gini-index, and misclassification error. The ideal criterion and maximum depth were determined using 5-fold cross validation upto a maximum depth of 10 for each criterion. The results of the cross validation showed that the entropy criterion with a maximum depth of 5 was the best performing model. The model was then tested on the test set and achieved an accuracy of 92.98%.
